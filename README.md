## TARIC-SLU: A Tunisian Benchmark Dataset For Spoken Language Understanding

The primary contributions of this work are as follows:
  1. Release of the TARIC-SLU corpus: The very first resource of its kind designed for SLU within the Tunisian dialect
  2. Comprehensive exposition of the semantic representations and annotation methodologies employed in the construction of the TARIC-SLU corpus.
  3. Release of an open-source SpeechBrain recipe to build the semantic tasks inherent to the TARIC-SLU dataset.
  4. Provides baseline results for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks, all derived from the TARIC-SLU corpus.
